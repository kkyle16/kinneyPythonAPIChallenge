## WeatherPy

In this activity we were tasked with accessing the OpenWeatherMap API and reading in data using only latitude and longitude. After creating a dictionary of over 500 cities and their current weather, I created a series of graphs to display potential correlation between latitude and various weather conditions. 

#### Observations

1) There is no correlation between latitude and windspeed. This is largely to be expected since there are more important factors that affect windspeed like proximity to large bodies of water or possibly altitude. 

2) Latitude was strongly correlated with maximum temperature in the northern hemisphere, and also correlated in the southern hemisphere but not as strongly. Additional research would need to be done to decide if this difference was signficant. In looking briefly at a map, the southern hemisphere contains about half as much landmass of the northern and cities on average would have a closer proximity to the ocean.

3) There is little to no correlation between latitude and cloudiness. Like windspeed, this is likely more dependent upon other factors than latitude.
